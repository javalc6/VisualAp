# VisualAp
VisualAp is a visual framework for building application and systems based on visual components.
# Overview
VisualAp can be used in order to perform audio processing, image processing, text and other process-driven emulation. VisualAp provides a visual framework based on lightweight components, called proclet.
The user can create an application by selecting the components from a toolbox, configuring the parameters (via the Javabeans framework), and connecting the components together in order to set-up communication channels between the components.

# Build
The batch file build.bat can be used to build the project. It generates the classes and two jar files: visualap-setup.jar and visualap.jar
# Install
VisualAp has to be installed by running visualap-setup.jar:
```
java -jar visualap-setup.jar
```
# Run
Launch VisualAp in one of the following alternatives:
