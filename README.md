# VisualAp
VisualAp is a visual framework for building application and systems based on visual components.
# Overview
VisualAp can be used in order to perform audio processing, image processing, text and other process-driven emulation. VisualAp provides a visual framework based on lightweight components, called proclet.
The user can create an application by selecting the components from a toolbox, configuring the parameters (via the Javabeans framework), and connecting the components together in order to set-up communication channels between the components. Please [click here](wiki/VisualAp.wiki) for more information.

# Build
The batch file build.bat can be used to build the project. It generates the classes and two jar files: visualap-setup.jar and visualap.jar
# Install
VisualAp has to be installed by running visualap-setup.jar:
```
java -jar visualap-setup.jar
```
Please [click here](wiki/Installation.wiki) for additional information.
# Run
Launch VisualAp in one of the following alternatives:
```
java -jar visualap.jar
```
or
```
java visualap.Visualap
```

* Select in the toolbox the “ReadFile” component, move and click the mouse pointer in the left side of the workspace: the component ReadFile is placed in the left side of the workplace
* Double-click the ReadFile component in the workspace: the properties window for ReadFile appears.
* In the properties window press the “Choose Filter” button, select the file “sassi.jpg” and press “Done”.
* Now select in the toolbox the “”ImageFilter” component, move and click the mouse pointer in the center of the workspace: the component ImageFilter is placed in the workplace.
* Connect the output pin of ReadFile to the input pin of the ImageFilter component.
* Now select in the toolbox the “”Viewer” component, move and click the mouse pointer in the right side of the workspace: the component Viewer is placed in the workplace.
* Connect the output pin of ImageFilter to the input pin of the Viewer component.
* Now check the system: System->Check, you should get a dialog with “System Check Passed” answer.
* Eventually you can run the system: System->Run, a new window pops-up with the inverted image.
* Double-click the ImageFilter component in the workspace: the properties window for ImageFilter appears. You can change the effect to 5x5Edge.
